# 🤖 JACVIS 1.0 — Voice-Controlled Agentic AI Powered by TinyLLaMA  
*By Team TriNetics*

Welcome to **JACVIS** — *Just Another Clever Voice-Integrated System* 🎙️  
JACVIS is a voice-driven, agentic assistant built on **Jac Language**, powered by **TinyLLaMA**, and fine-tuned for structured <llm> tasks in the MTLLM framework.

This is an official extension of **Project P3** from the Jac community's project list:
> **Fine-tuning TinyLLaMA for Enhanced Jac MTLLM Performance**

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

Our goal is to **fine-tune the TinyLLaMA model** to better handle structured Jac inputs/outputs — enabling accurate, type-safe completions through `<llm>` calls — *and* integrate it with **voice control** to demonstrate agentic interaction with:

- 🎤 **Voice Commands**
- 🧠 **LLM-backed structured reasoning**
- 🗃️ **Jac-native objects, walkers, and graphs**

---

## 🛠️ Current Build (v1.0)

### ✅ Core P3 Goals
- Create a **Jac-based fine-tuning dataset** using real MTLLM prompt-output pairs
- Fine-tune TinyLLaMA using LoRA or PEFT techniques
- Build a **Jac evaluation harness** to validate model accuracy and structure adherence
- Integrate the fine-tuned model as an MTLLM backend

### 🎙️ Voice-Controlled Extension (JACVIS)
- Use **speech-to-text input** for initiating agent tasks
- Dynamically select Jac walkers based on voice commands
- Convert structured outputs to **natural spoken responses**
- Serve as a smart interface layer for P3’s MTLLM logic

## 👨‍💻 Team TriNetics

We’re an enthusiastic team of innovators combining **LLMs + voice control + graph agents** to make something practical, scalable, and open-source. Our dream is to push JACVIS into a real JARVIS-style assistant one day — modular, local, and empowering!

## 🔍 What's Agentic About It?

- JACVIS performs autonomous decision-making using structured LLM completions
- Maintains internal state across user queries
- Routes user voice requests to correct Jac walkers
- Acts and responds as an intelligent, interactive **agent**
